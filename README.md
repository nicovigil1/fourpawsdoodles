#Genetics
There needs to be a way to automatically calculate the breed based off of the parents' breed - for later.

#Puppies
- Make it so that there is a default image for all puppers as well as a way to upload your own. - post production / pre-styling?

- Make it so that puppies are named "boy 1" "boy 2" (or girl a, girl b, girl c..) - maybe make it so that it goes off a count of the amount of puppies in that litter?

## Design
- the puppers index page should be grouped by mother's then by father's in their own cards/segments 

- previously placed puppies page - just an image of the puppy

### litter show page
- have a column for when the litter becomes available
    - need to edit the puppies to only be the ones that are unsold
    - this will also be the place where you can see each of the pupper's pictures. - the litter index will just be cards 



# Dog training page

## Validation tests needed for all models

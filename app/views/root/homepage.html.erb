      <p>FOUR PAWS DOODLES is located in a peaceful, rural Kansas setting 45 miles northeast of Wichita in Americaâ€™s heartland.</p>

      <p>Our family includes four children who act as our in-house puppy temperament testers. We stress a family oriented pet program focused on the development of true canine companions. Our four children are all very involved in the care and daily interaction with our adult dogs and the puppies. Their hands-on involvement is a major part of our puppy socialization program which is designed to insure well adjusted family pets. My husband and I are both graduates of Oklahoma State University.</p>
    
      <p>We are committed to raising high quality puppies that will be beautiful and loving companions for their future owners. Our careful genetic crossbreeding of Golden Retrievers to Poodles or Goldendoodles backcrossed to Poodles (F1B) has resulted in our line of intelligent, healthy , happy puppies that demonstrate the ability to easily adapt to new surroundings.</p>
    
      <p>Our puppies are bred to be loyal, intelligent, affectionate and low to non-shedding, thus often helping to reduce or eliminate allergic reactions in many owners. There can not be a guarantee as to the amount of, or lack of, shedding a individual coat type may end up producing. Thru surveys, it has been shown that even low shedding dogs have proven to be hypo-allergenic for most allergy suffers unlike other breeds.</p>
    
      <p>If you have questions please feel free to give us a call and we will try to help you find out if one of these puppies would be good addition for you and your family.</p>
